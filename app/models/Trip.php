<?php

// BEST PRACTICES:
// EACH CLASS SHOULD HAVE ITS OWN FILE. THERE SHOULD ONLY BE A SINGLE CLASS DEFINITION IN HERE.
// THE CLASSNAME SHOULD BE SINGULA AND CAPITALIZED: Company - Administration - Order - Person - Product.
// YOU NEVER INSTANTIATE THE CLASS IN THE CLASS FILE. NO $example = new Example(); in this file.

// Class Trip {

//  public $trips [];
 
 


//   public function __construct ($trips){
//       $this->trips = $trips;
    

//   }
  
    
// }
